## About Ruggedy

Ruggedy is a web application built in PHP, using the Laravel framework as a foundation.

It is built to assist pen testers, information security consultants, CISOs (Chief Information Security Officers), and anyone who is using tools like Burp, Nessus and Nexpose to do network and server security testing.

In the simplest terms, the application does the following:
- Consumes XML scan output files from Burp, Nessus or Nexpose.
- Provides an approachable, consistent user interface for analysing the data found in theses files.
- Allows you to add your own manual findings of vulnerabilities using the Ruggedy App, named after the company which founded the product.
- Allows you to group Vulnerabilities into "Folders".
- Makes it easy to send vulnerability information directly into Jira as a "Bug" issue.
