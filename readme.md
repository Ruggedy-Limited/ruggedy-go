## About Ruggedy VMA

Ruggedy VMA (Vulnerability Management App) is an open source web application built by [Ruggedy Limited](http://ruggedy.io) in PHP, using the Laravel framework as a foundation.

It is built to assist pen testers, information security consultants, CISOs (Chief Information Security Officers), and anyone who is using tools like Burp, Nessus and Nexpose, to do network and server security testing.

In the simplest terms, the application does the following:
- Consumes XML scan output files generated by Burp, Nessus or Nexpose security scanners.
- Provides an approachable, consistent user interface (UI) for analysing the data found in these files.
- Allows you to add your own manual findings of vulnerabilities using the Ruggedy App, named after the company that built this software.
- Allows you to group Vulnerabilities into "Folders".
- Enables collaboration through "comments" on vulnerability records.
- Makes it easy to send vulnerability information directly into Jira as a "Bug" issue.

## Requirements

This application has a few system requirements. All of these requirements are satisfied by the [Laravel Homestead virtual machine](https://laravel.com/docs/5.4/homestead), so it's highly recommended that you use Homestead if you are installing the application on your own machine.

However, if you are not using Homestead, you will need to make sure your server meets the following requirements:

- PHP >= 7
- OpenSSL PHP Extension
- PDO PHP Extension
- Mbstring PHP Extension
- Tokenizer PHP Extension
- XML PHP Extension
- A web server installed, e.g. Apache, Nginx etc.
- A running MySQL server with an empty database to use when installing the application
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) must be installed
- [Bower](https://bower.io) must be installed
- [NodeJS and NPM](http://nodejs.org/) must be installed
- [Git](http://git-scm.org/) must be installed

For more information on how to setup and configure your web server environment you can read the [Laravel documentation](http://laravel.com/docs).

## Setup and Installation

### Assumptions

The following instructions assume that you have configured your web server environment with all the above requirements, that you understand how to setup a web server to run a PHP-based web application, and that you have access to a bash (or similar) shell to run the below commands.

### Instructions

- Make sure your server environment meets all the requirments.
- Clone this repository with Git to a location accessible to PHP and your web server (Apache, Nginx etc.): `git clone https://github.com/Ruggedy-Limited/ruggedy-vma.git`
- Make a copy of the file named .env.example to a file named just .env, e.g. `cp ./.env.example ./.env`.
- It is **REQUIRED** that you open the .env file in an editor of your choice and configure your database connection: DB_HOST, DB_PORT, DB_DATABASE, DB_USERNAME, DB_PASSWORD.
- It is recommended that you customise the following options in the .env file: APP_ENV (local/development/production), APP_DEBUG (true/false), APP_URL (e.g. http://localhost).
- If you want the password reset functionality to send emails, configure your SMTP server in the .env file: MAIL_HOST, MAIL_PORT, MAIL_USERNAME, MAIL_PASSWORD, MAIL_ENCRYPTION, MAIL_FROM_NAME, MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS.

Now run the following commands from your shell while in the directory where the git repository was cloned:
- `composer install`
- `bower install`
- `npm install`
- `php artisan key:generate && php artisan migrate`
- `crontab -e` then add the following cron job to your crontab:
`* * * * * /path/to/php /path/to/ruggedy-vma/artisan schedule:run >> /path/to/ruggedy-vma/storage/logs/cron.log 2>&1`

NOTE: *In the cron entry, make sure you replace **/path/to** with the path relevant to your server/environment*.


If all of the above commands succeed, then the application should be installed, working and accessible via the URL/hostname you configured on your web server (Apache/Nginx). A default admin user is installed with the following credentials:  
Username: **admin@localhost**  
Password: **password**

It is highly recommended that you amend these details by logging in and making the relevant changes by clicking the "Profile" menu option on the main menu that can be accessed by clicking the hamburger menu icon at the top-left of the screen. 

## Development Roadmap

This still needs to be clearly defined, but the immediate plans are to make some improvements to the XML parser and to create a single command setup process in the next couple of months.
